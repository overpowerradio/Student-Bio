        <p>I became interested in web developent during the days of Myspace. The 3rd party websites would give you code to insert into your bio that would change your background and layout. I was fascinated by it. After starting a blog and purchasing a domain name, I felt void of the skill to publish websites as I imagined them. So many years later, here I am at UCF in a bootcamp to develop the creative skill I was longing for.
